# Web3 Portfolio

This page highlights my Web3 and blockchain-related projects, libraries, and documentation.

## NEAR Protocol — nearjsonrpc
- NEAR JSON-RPC documentation and examples: https://sawsimeon.github.io/nearjsonrpc/
- Purpose: Reference and example requests for interacting with the NEAR blockchain programmatically using the JSON-RPC interface.
- Includes example curl requests and code snippets to help developers interact with NEAR nodes and query on-chain data.

## cowr (R) — Cow Protocol bindings (in development)
- Repository: https://github.com/sawsimeon/cowr
- Purpose: R package providing helpers and bindings to interact with Cow Protocol (continuous on-chain order workflows and MEV strategies).
- Status: Active development — aims to simplify interacting with Cow Protocol from R and enable reproducible on-chain experiments.

## qsar (Rust) — QSAR tooling and descriptors
- Docs: https://docs.rs/qsar/0.0.2/qsar/index.html
- Purpose: Rust crate providing utilities for quantitative structure–activity relationships, molecular descriptor calculations and related tooling.
- Useful for high-performance descriptor computation in pipelines where Rust integration is beneficial.

## igfetchr (R) — CRAN package
- CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igfetchr/index.html
- Purpose: R package igfetchr is to provide a convenient interface for accessing the IG Trading REST API, allowing users to fetch market data, query historical prices, execute trades, and retrieve account details directly within R, with results returned as tidy tibbles for easy analysis.
- Published on CRAN; includes examples and documentation.
