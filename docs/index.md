## Summary

I specialize in computational methods and informatics with a focus on molecular descriptors and fingerprints for representing chemical compounds as numerical vectors. My work combines machine learning, model explainability, and high-performance computing (HPC) to accelerate virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.

Highlights
- Machine learning for molecular properties (cell permeability, scoring functions)
- Descriptor engineering and post-hoc attribution for model explainability
- High Performance Computing for deep docking and large-scale rescoring
- Front-end development with R Shiny to support interactive data exploration and decision making
- Experienced in Python (Keras/TensorFlow), R (Shiny), Git, and SQL
