## Summary

I specialize in computational methods and informatics with a strong focus on molecular descriptors and fingerprints for representing chemical compounds as numerical vectors. My work combines machine learning, model explainability, and high-performance computing (HPC) to accelerate virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery. I design descriptor engineering pipelines and attribution methods that make predictive models interpretable and actionable in drug discovery workflows.

In addition to cheminformatics, I actively contribute to the Web3 and financial technology ecosystem by developing R packages for blockchain, forex trading, and cryptocurrency analytics. These packages provide interfaces to decentralized APIs, enable reproducible trading strategies, and integrate financial data streams into R’s analytical environment. My work bridges scientific computing with decentralized finance, empowering researchers and traders with transparent, reproducible, and scalable tools.

Highlights

- Machine learning for molecular properties: predictive modeling of cell permeability, scoring functions, and bioactivity.

- Descriptor engineering & fingerprints: development of numerical representations for chemical compounds to power ML models.

- Post-hoc attribution & explainability: SHAP, LIME, and custom attribution methods for transparent model interpretation.

- High Performance Computing (HPC): deep docking, large-scale rescoring, and parallelized workflows for millions of compounds.

- Front-end development with R Shiny: interactive dashboards for data exploration, visualization, and decision support.

- R package development for financial analytics: author of [igfetchr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igfetchr/index.html), an R interface to the IG Trading REST API for forex and CFD trading.

- Blockchain & Web3 integration in R: developer of [nearjsonrpc](https://sawsimeon.github.io/nearjsonrpc/), an R package to interact with the NEAR Protocol JSON RPC API for decentralized applications.

- Rust for cheminformatics: contributor to [qsar](https://docs.rs/qsar/0.0.2/qsar/index.html), a Rust crate for quantitative structure–activity relationship modeling and molecular descriptor computation.

- Cross-domain expertise: bridging cheminformatics, decentralized finance, and blockchain analytics with reproducible scientific and financial workflows.

- Technical stack: Python (Keras/TensorFlow), R (Shiny, package dev), Rust (QSAR crates), Git, SQL, and cloud/HPC environments.
